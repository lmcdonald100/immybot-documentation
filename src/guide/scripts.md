# Scripts

## Script Types

A script will have a specific type.  This type determines which variables and commands will be available in the script.

### Software Detection

These scripts  **must return a string that will cast to a valid `System.Version`**. 
Returning an actual `System.Version` will fail. 
For example 
```
$version = [String]"1.2.3"
return $version
```
will work, but currently 
```
$version = [System.Version]"1.2.3"
return $version
```
will fail.

Software Detection scripts are used to determine whether an existing software is present and what version it may be.

### Software Auto Update

These scripts are useful for automatically adding new versions for a software.
Script should return a `$SoftwareVersion` object.
```
$SoftwareVersion = @{}
$SoftwareVersion.url = $LatestPackage.OriginFile.OriginUri
$SoftwareVersion.displayVersion = $VersionFromMsi
return $SoftwareVersion
```

### Software Version Action

These scripts an be used on a software version for installation, post-installation, uninstallation, post-uninstallation, testing, and upgrade scripts.

### Maintenance Task

These scripts are available only on maintenance tasks.

### Metascript Deployment Target

These scripts are used on deployments as a target.

They **must return `$true` or `$false`**.

A value of `$true` indicates that the computer applies to this deployment.  A value of `$false` indicates that the computer does not apply to this deployment.

### Filter Script Deployment Target

These scripts are used on deployments as a target.

They **must return a `Computer[]` array**.

The deployment will only apply to computers specified in the returned array.

## Script Execution Contexts

A script will have a specific execution context.  This context determines how the script gets run.

### System

The script runs on the computer under the system user.

### User

The script runs on the computer under a specific user.

### Metascript

The script runs on the server in the context of a specific computer.

### Cloudscript

The script runs on the server in the context of a specific tenant.
