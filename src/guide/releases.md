## 0.48.0

Released 2021-11-29

### IMPORTANT
---

#### **The changes in this release will require reconsent at first login!**

**â“˜ If your Azure AD is configured to not allow non-Admin users to consent to new apps, you will need to login once as a user with sufficient privileges.**

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/4aebeec7-2bcf-414f-952e-272e3deaffc5)

- Consolidated backend and frontend into a single Enterprise Application (Service Principal)
- Removed `backend.subdomain.immy.bot` and pointed all API calls to `subdomain.immy.bot`
  - This has the additional benefit of increasing performance as the browser no longer makes a CORS pre-flight check when hitting the API
    - Note: If you are using the ImmyBot API, you will need to remove `backend.` from your URI

## 0.47.12

Released 2021-11-29

- Fixed an issue with nested exceptions not showing the correct output

## 0.47.10

Released 2021-11-23

### Improvements
---

- Ephemeral Agent EXE respects global proxies for https:// even though it uses wss://

### Bug Fixes
---

- Fixed issue where Ephemeral Agent EXE failed to launch due to an extraction issue on Windows Server Core

## 0.47.9

Released 2021-11-22

### Bug Fixes
--- 

1. Fixed an issue with inventory and script-run cancellation logic causing high memory usage
1. Fixed an issue with function scripts being used in metascripts causing heavy load on global database
1. Switched to force Ephemeral Agent EXE to utilize System Proxy settings to alleviate connection refusal for some users
1. Fixed an issue with PowerShell execution occasionally throwing an error that would crash ImmyBot

## 0.47.8

Released 2021-11-17

### Features

#### Ephemeral Agent EXE

1. The ephemeral agent now executes as an `.exe` instead of a PowerShell script.  
1. This allows us to use a WebSocket instead of polling, which improves performance and resiliency as we can immediately detect disconnections.
1. Decreased initial connection time by attempting to connect using all RMMs simultaneously instead of in sequence.
1. Substantially improved logging to help troubleshoot script execution issues

**Note: You may have to exclude your instance's hostname in the firewall from SSL Inspection policies! SSL Inspection may interfere with the WebSocket connection from this new agent!**

**Note: You may also need to adjust your security software to allow the EXE to execute. We recommend adding an exclusion for the Immense Networks code signing certificate as it will be used to sign all ImmyBot PowerShell scripts and Executables.**

The subject of the certificate is:
```
CN=Immense Networks, O=Immense Networks, L=Baton Rouge, S=Louisiana, C=US
```

### Improvements
- Inventory scripts now run in parallel
- ImmyBot will always overwrite license files to prevent issues with software not activating because the previous license file is still in the ImmyBot download folder.
- The script terminal on the computer details page is no longer cleared when swapping between tabs.
- Updated the instance disabled text to specify that only an admin user can re-enable immy

### Bug Fixes
- The EXE ephemeral agent addresses intermittent ScriptTimeout exceptions that would occur for a variety of reasons
- Implemented a "Script Execution Circuit Breaker" per computer to prevent RMM overload when retrying ephemeral connections (This can happen when security software blocks execution or firewalls prevent outbound connections)
- Fixed several issues around script error handling.  Line numbers now display correctly.  Exceptions that occur before running a script are now caught and displayed properly.
- Fixed an issue where inventory output with a value of `null` was being treated as successful and overwriting good results
- Fixed a bug with session logs showing null references when a script was cancelled or timed out
- Fixed a bug with quick deploy where the deployment resolution stage was unnecessarily reaching out to the computer to retrieve its software
- Fixed a bug during maintenance sessions, `Field at index '1' does not exist...`, where retrieving the list of installed chocolatey software would fail
- Resolved a potential issue around re-acquiring ephemeral agent sessions under concurrent script execution scenarios
- Fixed a bug when re-authenticating to ImmyBot where you wouldn't be redirected to the page you were previously on due to the URL not including query parameters






## 0.47.0

Released 2021-10-28

### Maintenance Execution Order
---

You can now specify the order in which maintenance items are executed by navigating to "/deployments/ordering" or by clicking the "Ordering" link in the side nav bar under "Deployments".

![Maintenance Execution Order](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/itemorderingscreenshot.png)

### Other Improvements
---

- Made the software, maintenance task, script, and media list pages default to showing "All" for convenience.  Additionally made small changes to these pages to make them more consistent in their appearance.
- Configuration tasks are now executed immediately after their compliant software.
- Refactored some code to be platform agnostic in preparation for hosting ImmyBot in Linux instead of Windows
- Made some internal improvements to how we store core PowerShell code that will make development and script signing easier
- Allowed dynamic version software to use the "Update If Found" desired state
- Allowed inventory to use metascripts
- Parallelized inventory to run up to 4 scripts in parallel for faster execution
- When creating scripts from a software or maintenance task, the script name will now have a default value. E.g. If creating a new installation script the default name will be " Installation Script" made in this MR for use in release notes
- Added a maintenance item column to the schedule list page
- Simplified the "Getting Started Wizard"
- Removed unnecessary padding in the "Getting Started Wizard"
- New instances will now automatically approve all recommended target assignments

### Bug Fixes
---

- Fixed a bug with adding the CW Automate integration where it would throw an error if the list of clients being imported was extremely large
- Fixed command-line scripts so uninstall logic works as expected
- Updated the target assignment resolution to exclude assignments that are tied to disabled provider links
- Fixed a bug where the test script on a software was not getting called if the software was detected
- Fixed a bug with maintenance item ordering where the preferred initial order of recommended items was not being set
- Fixed an issue that was causing a memory leak that scaled with the number of ImmyBot agent installers

## 0.46.9

Released 2021-10-04

### Bug Fixes
---

- Fixed a bug where configuration tasks were failing with `"Parameter '<parameter name>' is marked required for Maintenance Task...and no value has been set"` when the parameter value was actually set

## 0.46.8

Released 2021-09-30

### Bug Fixes
---

- Fixed a bug with maintenance tasks where the default parameter value was being used instead of the overridden value

- Fixed a bug with running user context scripts where an error was being swallowed and the scripts would inevitably time out
- Fixed an issue with updating the "Installer Executable Path / Installer File" field on the software version form where it would revert to the previous value
- Fixed a bug where software marked as "Download Only" would attempt to run its configuration task.  Software that is set to download only no longer adds an action for its configuration task.
- Fixed an issue that was causing the azure user sync to stop running.  When it encounters an issue syncing a specific tenant, it will now log some details that will help the immy team determine why it is failing and then continue attempting to sync other tenants.
- Fixed a bug with running `Get-AgentInstallScript` where it would return the error `Tenant # is not linked to a client for the specified provider`
- Fixed a bug saving the onboarding form where we were not disabling the onboarding save buttons while the page was still loading.  Attempting to to save before the page was loaded was causing an error to be thrown
- Fixed a bug where the branding list was showing brandings as "Expired" when they actually weren't
- Fixed a bug where updating brandings with no selected tenant would cause the branding to get deleted instead
- Fixed a bug where using the "Re-inventory" button on the computer details page would often time out and show an error

- Fixed a bug where after uploading and analyzing software, the analyzed upgrade code was not executing the search to see if it was found on existing machines
- Fixed a bug on the computer list page where a computer's online status was considering disabled links.  Since a disabled link can result in stale data, we no longer use them to determine the online status of a computer.
- Fixed a bug with clicking the "Delete Offline Agent" button on the computer agents tab
- Fixed a bug where default configuration task parameters were missing when deploying from the computer software tab
- Fixed a null reference exception that was occurring when attempting to run a script against an offline computer

- Fixed a bug with assigning a local download installer script to a local software

## 0.46.4

Released 2021-09-16

## 0.46.2

Released 2021-09-15

### Improvements
---

- Changed ImmyAgent to use callbacks internally to response to Ephemeral Agent script start events. This should improve issues where the Ephemeral Agent doesn't start when using the ImmyAgent
- Added a new switch parameter to `Invoke-ImmyCommand` called `-IncludeLocals`, which will automatically include all variables from the metascript runspace.  When using `-IncludeLocals` you no longer need to specify $using variables.

### Bug Fixes
---

- Fixed an issue where system scripts timeouts were not being honored
- Fixed backwards-compatibility of `Get-RmmInfo`and `Get-RmmComputer` metascripts
- Fixed an issue with automate groups not loading on deployment form
- Fixed a null reference bug when calculating MD5 hashes
- Fixed a bug with `Invoke-ImmyCommand` where $using variables were throwing a warning: `WARNING: Parameter '__using_command' already exists with value "some-value"`

## 0.46.1

Released 2021-09-14

### Bug Fixes
---

Fix ImmyAgent bug which would cause Temp PS1 path to not be created.

## 0.46.0

Released 2021-09-14

### Ephemeral Agent Script Execution
---

ImmyBot now uses "Ephemeral Agents" for script execution.

This new method will normalize the time it takes to run scripts across all RMM Providers. The initial payload to start the ephemeral agent will be sent through the RMM, but then all subsequent scripts will communicate directly with the ephemeral agent.

An Ephemeral Agent is a lightweight PowerShell script that establishes a direct connection with the ImmyBot backend via Polling or SSE (Server-Sent Events) to receive script payloads to execute. Script output is then sent through an Azure Service Bus for high throughput handling.  The ImmyBot backend manages the lifetime of ephemeral agents and is able to re-use them efficiently.

### Script Path Preference
---

It is now easier to whitelist ImmyBot in your Antivirus. The Ephemeral Agent will use a script path containing a hash unique to your instance that you can rekey yourself.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/e29c58d2-d877-430c-b1b3-6035e855038e)

### Default Software Scripts
---

You can now specify install, uninstall, post-install, post-uninstall, upgrade, and test scripts directly on the software.

This reduces duplication for software where the versions use the same exact scripts while also making software easier to manage.

**Considerations**

1. If the software has a script and the desired version has a script, then the script on the version takes precedence. (e.g. the version's install script will be used instead of the software's install script if both are present)
1. If the version does not have a script, then we will attempt to use the one on the software if the script is present.

### Custom Download Script
---

You can now assign a "Download Installer" script to software that will be used instead of the core Immy download installer logic.  This is valuable when downloading 3rd party installers from URLs that require authentication or specific headers.

### Other Improvements
---

- Combined RMM Links and PSA Links into a single Integrations page under Settings
- Improved Tarma InstallMate package analyzer detection
- Added documentation for Ephemeral Agent & ServiceBus Script-Result handler info tiles in System Status page to better explain what they mean, and how to discern specific pieces of information from them
- Fixed an issue where password parameters with `$` characters were getting stripped
ServiceBus Script-Result handling & Ephemeral Agent sessions are enabled by default for new Instances
- Integration type capabilities are now listed on the New Integration page
- ServiceBus Script-Result handling can now process results at a much higher throughput & more reliably than before.
- ServiceBus Result latency has been improved to around ~100ms under normal load conditions from ~3s.
- Implemented caching for tenant preferences to reduce database calls during maintenance sessions
- Reduced some complexity in how we structure RMM Links and PSA Links (now known as integrations)
- Reworded script-start-failed log to not include integration link name since the integration is not responsible for starting the scripts
- Added basic logging of inventory script names and any errors to session logs

### Bug Fixes
---

### Improvements
---

- `Invoke-ImmyCommand` can now run on multiple computers in parallel, using the `-Parallel` switch
- MSP Admin users can now set a flag `Allow Access To MSP Resources` on schedules that will allow all scripts run by the schedule to have access to MSP resources.

### Tenant Details Page Improvements
---

1. Added a cloud / computer type selector to the sessions and actions tabs.
1. Replaced the tasks tab with an actions tab
1. Added a schedules tab

The actions tab shows the latest actions performed against a computer or tenant.  This table can be used to help identify issues with software and maintenance tasks.

#### Example 1: Find all computers that have a large number of failing actions

Filter the status column to non-compliant and then group by the computer.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/253ae11d-3c33-4da6-9b0d-2fe085546034)

#### Example 2: Find software and maintenance tasks that are failing across many computers

### Dashboard - Load Top 10 Non-Compliant Items
---

A new button was added to the dashboard, `Load Top 10 Non-Compliant Items`, that will show up when you have selected a tenant scoped target. This can be used as a quick way to identify issues for devices.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/cbc243f5-e240-4d9d-847f-5a1ebc095d99)

- Added a configuration task tag to configuration task maintenance actions on the session details page

## 0.44.0

Released 2021-06-28

### Quick Deploy
---

Deploying software for a specific computer is now easier.   Located at the top of the Software tab on the computer details page.  Tell your techs to use this form if they need to deploy software to a specific computer.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/c70b0628-847b-40b6-99db-456f69ce5115)

After selecting a software / maintenance task that you want to deploy, a session will be kicked off to determine if the computer has any applicable deployments.  If a deployment is found, then you'll be presented actions for that deployment.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/87d9a5a0-0f1d-41ea-94ba-8868fbe674f5)

If a deployment is not found, then you are asked if you would like to create one.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/e268d0b8-2538-4019-bbe3-492468f162d8)

If the selected item requires configuration task parameter values or a license, then you still need to create the deployment from the traditional deployment page.  We plan on expanding on this to allow supplying a license and parameters directly on this form.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/f351d75d-738e-4acb-9588-3103842fcda4)

### Computer List Search Improvements
---

Searching for computers is now much faster after some internal refactoring of how the data was stored.  We removed the need to select a filter so you can now search by any of the available fields specified in the placeholder.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/ae56632e-651a-4e41-8f4d-0f62d6947f47)
- Added `Onboarding` as a support Target Type for convience.
- Made device inventory storage processes more efficient and started caching some often-accessed computer data (like computer names)

### Download ImmyBot Agent Installer Improvements
---

Updated the interface for downloading an immy agent installer.  You can now assign default behavior to any of the installation methods.  The `Deploy` tab will now automatically update when your computer shows up in ImmyBot.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/7ab85162-0ce8-49bd-ab16-a76a6c105dab)

### Inventory Results over Service Bus (Beta)
---

Inventory scripts sent over any Rmm Provider connection will have their results sent over an Azure ServiceBus connection.  This allows us to stream results in real-time, eliminating message size constraints.  Since this is a new feature, you must manually enable this functionality under preferences.  In a later release, we will extend the service bus script result handling to all scripts ran through Immy

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/39e9a698-cff7-4db5-af1d-d34dd0b74c64)

- Fixed some issues with the agent update stage

## 0.43.0

Released 2021-06-01

### Agent Updating
---

The Immy Agent now gets updated during full maintenance sessions.  You can also manually trigger an update by going to the computer's details page and under the Agents tab.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/a6a6cdbb-f45e-4b95-91a9-e4272979527c)

### Assignment Override
---

As part of a refactor of the computer software tab, we added the ability to override assignments.  This is useful when resolving one off computers that do not need to be part of a larger assignment.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/0a02d6ac-21f5-425d-8ab7-1b881d7d16f2)

### Getting Started Wizard
---

A new 'Getting Started' feature is available, which guides the user through first-time ImmyBot setup and installation of the ImmyAgent on a device using PPKG.  You can access this feature by clicking the "show Getting Started Wizard" link under your user email dropdown in the top right.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/e24d1489-c7fa-46ed-bde9-8a9bde0df04f)

### Recommended Deployments
---

A recommended deployment is a global deployment that is accessible to all ImmyBot users.  Recommended deployments represent common scenarios that most companies use.  You can approve / dismiss recommended deployments.  Approving a deployment will allow it to be considered as a valid deployment when running maintenance.  Dismissing a deployment will disallow it from being considered during maintenance.

When a new recommended deployment is added, you will receive a notification, "You have new recommended deployments".  Clicking this link will prompt you to approve / disapprove the deployment.

You can manage the approval of all recommended deployments from the main Deployment List page by clicking the "View Recommended Deployments" button at the top.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/479a8f6b-14b1-45c6-a5d5-97d9fd8a6d04)

### Deployment: Multiple Action Results
---

The deployment page can now show multiple action results.  This is useful when a software has a configuration task or dependencies.

When there are 2 actions:

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/66e95cd9-7ec8-4c8e-b78e-20dc597194c5)

When there are more than 2 actions:

### Bug Fixes
---

- Fixed issue with merging tenants where some users were receiving the following error: `Configured execution strategy SqlServerRetryingExecutionStrategy does not support user initiated transactions `
- Fixed issues with determining winning deployments.  A tenant filter script now has priority over a cross tenant filter script.  Ordering has also been added to the target group filter.  E.g. A deployment targeting primary domain controllers will now take priority over a deployment targeting servers.
- Fixed issue where multiple actions returned on the edit deployment screen would overwrite each other when previewing or deploying
- Fixed extra spacing between items on the computer software list
- Fixed issue where some null dates were showing as Jan 01 0001 - They now show as n/a.

- Fixed issue with the deployment details page slug having duplicate text

## 0.42.2

### Improvements
---

- Added ability to merge and delete tenants
- Reduced agent install MSI from 41MB to 14MB
- ImmyAgent can now be installed without an internet connection
  - The Provisioning Package now embeds the MSI instead of downloading it, preventing the need for an internet
- ImmyAgent Service is now a single exe file
- ImmyAgent gracefully shuts down quickly preventing connection errors on service restart because the previous process is still running
- Better online/offline tracking: ImmyAgent now sends messages to the backend to indicate when it connects and disconnects. The prevents issues where a restart may not be noticed on machines that reboot quickly because the IoTHub filters out connection events that happen quickly.
- When joining the domain from the Onboarding screen, the logs indicate what domain controller is being used to fetch the offline domain join token
- When scripts are running in the Metascript context, we say execution is happening in the ImmyBot Backend instead of 'Server' as it could be confused with a server managed by ImmyBot

### Bug Fixes
---

- Fixed Offline Domain join
  - This also fixed an issue where Invoke-ImmyCommand would not respect the Computer argument
- Fixed issue where license values werent being provided during Onboarding sessions
- Fixed issue where PPKG would fail to apply if wireless was specified and the machine doesn't have a wireless adapter
- Fixed an issue with upgrades failing for global softwares that use choco provider

- Fixed issue causing deployments to fail when global software is linked to Ninite and Ninite integration is not enabled.
- Fixed an issue where rekeyed agents never show up in Immy.
- Fixed an issue with rerunning script from tenant session trying to run against a computer
- Fixed an issue that could cause the first instance of a schedule to not run if the schedule was created between your timezone's offset and midnight. (I.E Between 6PM CDT and Midnight CDT)

## 0.42.1

---

- Fixed an issue on the deployment form when invalid text would incorrectly show up when a chocolatey or ninite software was selected
- Fixed an issue that was preventing successful installs of ninite and chocolatey software

## 0.42.0

### Tenant Details Page
---
Added a tenant details page similar to the computer details page.  The tenant list page link has been moved out from `Settings -> Tenants` to the top level in the navbar.

1. Maintenance sessions run directly against a tenant can be viewed in the Sessions tab.
1. Assigned Tenant Maintenance Tasks can be viewed in the Tasks tab.
1. The Terminal tab is auto scoped to run meta scripts for a particular tenant.
1. The Mappings tab allows you to link/un-link a tenant from RMM Providers.
1. The edit tab allows you to change the name of the tenant.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/33988012-0209-4220-9fa8-dc6a8211f3a2)

### Software Providers
---

#### What is a Software Provider?

A Software Provider tells ImmyBot how to install/uninstall a software.  Currently, Local, Global, Chocolatey and Ninite are supported as providers.  You can assign the available providers to a software on the software's edit page.  A local/global software will inherently be a Local/Global Provider if there are software versions present.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/a54835ec-7977-48f4-85c6-b9cce0f53c5f)

The provider that is used during a maintenance session can be specified on the deployment. For example, if the Chocolatey provider is added on a software and is selected on a deployment, then Immy will always attempt to install/uninstall the software through Chocolatey.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/2ee5c1c5-0011-4f82-bb9b-983b4aafffcb)

If a specific provider is not selected, then the software will be installed/uninstalled using the following logic:

1. If the deployment is set to install the latest version or update if found, then the provider that contains the latest software version will be used.
   - e.g. If chocolatey has a newer software version then global, then chocolatey will be used.
1. For any other desired state, the local/global provider will be used (normal behavior).

If the Ninite integration is enabled and Ninite is set as an alternate provider, then Ninite will take priority over Local/Global and Chocolatey.

### Detection Outdated
---

Added a flag to computers to indicate that a deployment for the computer has been updated and that detection should be re-run to ensure the computer is up to date.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/1fbec2a1-cf19-402a-8118-4596c3d835dd)

### Computer Software Page Updates
---

Added more tabs to filter the computer's software list

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/8f25f22c-ab5d-4d7b-8ebd-db40321d6718)

#### Unassignable

The unassignable tab lists all software that exist on the computer but does not exist in ImmyBot as managed Software.

#### Assignable

The assignable tab now has two potential actions: **Quick Assign** and **Assign**.  Quick Assign will immediately create a deployment targeting the primary person (if present) or the computer.  A detection only session will also start immediately to determine the current state of the software.  Assign will open the New Deployment Page and allow you to create a new assignment for the software.  Quick assign is currently only available for software that do not have a configuration task or a license.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/396d2451-2e36-4793-b63f-99ed514bd536)

#### Assigned

The assigned tab now provides 3 potential actions: **Action to take (Install, Update, Enforce, etc)**, **Re-run detection (refresh icon)**, and **Manage (edit deployment)**"

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/016316a8-470a-42e8-a57a-b2c79ebb512f)

- String variables passed into a remote runspace now get expanded automatically just like running normal scripts, preventing the need to run ExpandString on variables containing paths like $InstallerFile and $InstallerFolder
    - ```powershell
      Invoke-ImmyCommand {
          # This is no longer necessary
          $InstallerFile = $ExecutionContext.InvokeCommand.ExpandString($using:InstallerFile)

Configuration Tasks are used to provide parameters to software install scripts and/or provide additional configuration after the software is installed.  Checking this box allows you to select this Maintenance Task from the Configuration Task section of the 'Edit Software' page. Configuration Tasks are not select-able on the 'Edit Deployment' Page to prevent accidental deployment without the associated software.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/ec4caad0-653c-47e1-9ed3-4cc465e62e2e)

The Configuration Task selector on the Software Edit Page now only show maintenance tasks that have Configuration Task checked.

#### Media
---
ImmyBot now officially supports uploading media that can be used in Maintenance Tasks as file parameters.  Existing media can now be selected from the media library for re-use on multiple maintenance tasks.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/fd69024e-cbf5-4940-8dfa-b42c25c7e886)

#### Detection Only Maintenance Sessions
---

Detection only maintenance sessions are replacing the "Preview" feature where we determine what needs to be done for a computer to be compliant without actually enforcing compliance.  The benefit over the old "preview" is that detection only maintenance sessions will persist to the database.

A detection only session will gather all deployments for a computer, and if the computer is online, it will then run detection to determine compliance.  If the computer is offline, it will only determine what the desired state is.

#### Additional computer software list filtering
---

Added additional filtering to the computer's software list that allows you to filter by managed software, inventoried software, or both.  Also, a toggle to show "Hidden Items" was added to show or hide system component inventoried software.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/0e0cc80d-3e40-496b-aace-fcf3025f38d4)

#### Max session indicator
---

Updated the Sessions List page headers to show Created Sessions and the max number of running sessions Immy can run concurrently.

## 0.40.2

Released 2021-03-08

### Azure Improvements


----Added the ability to create tenants from your Azure Customers from the Azure page.  This is convenient for those only using the ImmyBot Agent, and want to quickly create tenants from their Azure Customers. We also added the Azure Customer Domain to the table since this may be valuable to see.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/22e52fe4-1739-49e3-b624-d3cd307be64b)

### Chocolatey Improvements
---

Our managed server that proxies and caches Chocolatey requests can at times be unreliable.  Also, this server is not geographically replicated so it is not the best solution for those using ImmyBot outside of the US. We added logic that automatically falls back to using Chocolatey directly whenever our managed server is responding poorly.  We also improved our caching which resulted in better response times and fewer requests sent to Chocolatey.

### Script Session Logs Improvements
---

Updated the styling of script session logs.  Clicking "Open Debugger" now copies the script output to the terminal.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/0681edc0-c106-4e2c-8ed9-649cd7fe3473)

### Schedule Improvements
---

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/8f1f906f-4e21-4f16-998e-32f4563f600d)

### Deployment Improvements
---

Deployment options more clearly indicate that they will only affect sessions created on the deployment page and will not be saved with the deployment itself.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/dae05886-dc34-46fb-871a-582992fc75fa)

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/7d7ccc18-bb2b-49b1-9032-3bf74ab3192d)

### Improved Custom Detection Script logic
---

Custom Detection Scripts can now return any output as long as the last word is a valid semantic version.

#### Example

```powershell
write-output "The version found is 1.0.0" ## translates to a detected version of 1.0.0
write-output "Version:`n`n1.0.0" ## translates to a detected version of 1.0.0
```

### Bug Fixes
---
1. Fixed issues with setting appropriate fields when the analyzer returns data for an uploaded software
1. Fixed an issue where new computers were not getting moved to onboarding after being identified if the computer already existed.
1. Fixed an issue when re-installing with the uninstall/install method, where the installer failed to downloaded and left the software uninstalled
1. Replaced the word "undetermined" in Immy emails with a blank
1. Fixes an issue displaying output logs for cloud scripts on the deployment page

1. Enabled the metascript execution context for custom detection scripts
1. Removed the "all scripts are disabled for task" alert on the deployment form for configuration tasks
1. Fixed a bug on the deployment form where it would not let you save if you changed the selected maintenance item from one software to another

1. Fixed a bug preventing the logout button from working
## 0.40.0

Released 2021-02-24

#### Dashboard Page
---

Added a new page that can provide you the latest actions for software and maintenance tasks that were run against a group of computers.  The page is intended to help produce audits and show whether or not computers are compliant.  This page is a work in progress and will be iterated on over the next few weeks.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/7a0c32f8-3011-450a-94a1-2633b6a65c09)

##### How to use it

1. Select a target scope for the computers you are interested in.
1. Select one or more software or maintenance tasks
1. The table will then show you a green check, a red x, or nothing to indicate the compliance of the selected item for that computer
    - A green check indicates that the latest action for the item is compliant.
    - A red x indicates that the latest action for the item is not compliant.
    - Nothing indicates that ImmyBot has not run an action against the computer for the item.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/22f43392-98f8-42f5-9923-4ef171a657f5)

- You can filter the data for each software or maintenance task added by clicking the filter button next to the item's name.
- You can remove an item from the table by clicking the red X button next to the item's name.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/532a234c-7deb-44aa-8097-e1be0465ada6)

- Click the `xlsx` button located at the top-right corner of the table to export the data in the table.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/2cc6c4be-09a2-489c-876e-18c8fcdd10b0)

- The excel export will contain an "Overview" worksheet, that provides you the compliancy of the selected software and tasks for each computer.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/555ff1ca-f2f9-47bd-967b-b7a7ae111e7f)

- For each software and task you have in the table, an additional worksheet will be added that provides you information about the latest action taken.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/8d1bb0b7-ca66-427d-bb27-4d08cdccda76)

#### Restart ImmyBot
---
Added a **Restart ImmyBot** button to the System Status Page.  The System Status Page has been moved to the top of the navbar.

*Note*: Only MSP Admin users can see this page.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/830b95ea-9f95-4d35-b878-27de5ddb4303)

#### Get-RmmInstallScript Metascript
---

Exposed new metascript `Get-RmmInstallSCript -RmmLinkId <int>` that will return a script block containing the powershell install script for the specified rmm link.  This is was added to provide an quick way to update the ImmyBot Agent on computers.  Long term, we will add auto update logic to the ImmyBot Agents so we don't have to do this.

##### Example usage

```powershell
$RmmInfo = Get-RmmInfo -ProviderType ImmybotAgent
$ScriptBlock = Get-RmmInstallScript -RmmLinkId $RmmInfo.RmmLinkId
Invoke-ImmyCommand $ScriptBlock
```
#### Improved Software Detection
---

We expanded the "Software Table" detection method to have three search modes: Contains, Regex, and Traditional.

We added a lookup table that can search the known software on your computers to help create better detection methods.

The **Contains** search mode allows you to target software using a contains search.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/2fd1fa6c-7a5a-4e1f-b31b-2a8f25df8c0c)

The **Regex** search mode allows to target software using regular expressions.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/acb119f1-2b67-4ccc-85f4-cb51ed455f93)

The **Traditional** search mode is the old detection style used by ImmyBot.  This method is essentially the same as Regex, but replaces occurrences of * with .*

##### Software Lookup Table
---

The table will show software already installed on your computers that matches the detection method you provide.

We provide the software name, version, upgrade code (if present), and how many computers in your instance have it installed.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/2ae846c2-29e0-4819-8b0e-3d09e3dc5336)

#### Software Repair

$Parameters variable now additionally added to Metascripts to allow easy passing of all parameters to remote machines

```powershell
$Parameters.ComputerName
Invoke-ImmyCommand {
    $Parameters = $using:Parameters
    $Parameters.ComputerName
}
```

### Timezone Support for Schedules

- Schedules now have the ability to specify a timezone.  The detection and execution time are then relative to the selected timezone. If you use a custom cron expression, then it will also be relative to the selected timezone.  The default option will be UTC to match the previous functionality.
